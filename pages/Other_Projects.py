st.markdown("# House Price Prediction with Random Forests")

st.markdown("""
In this project, I created a small app from my solution to the Kaggle competition: [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/overview). 
Even though this competition is intended to be a learning experience rather than a challenge, 
it allows the application of some of the most essential concepts in solving machine learning problems. Here, I list the main steps for this project:

- I will explain how I dealt with missing values, emphasizing the importance of exploratory analysis.
- I will give a detailed explanation of how categorical features were numerically encoded.
- The method for training the model is explained.
            
Using this methodology, I reached position 479 on a leaderboard of about 60,000 competitors. 
Because no complex feature engineering was performed, this is a considerable achievement. 
Note that the central goal of this project was not the modeling part but the preprocessing stage.
            
The complete code and development steps are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AlbertoR94/house-prices-prediction/tree/master).
